### Project Statement

A new falafel stand company with big ambitions and a lot of marketing dollars to spend wants to make a big first impression on the New York city street food scene. They're hiring us to help them make strategic use of NY MTA data, in order to:
* place ads by location, not to exceed 5, such that the number of potential falafel-buyers who see their ads is maximized, and 
* use data to provide clever, attention-grabbing ad content for the placements

As an imagined example, we may use in-out turnstile data to find a station that is highly traveled, and suggest the creation a billboard ad that displays inside the subway station walls, addressing viewers with an interesting descriptive statistic: "You're going to spend an average of 3.7 minutes standing and waiting for this train. Conveniently, that's about how long it takes it eat this hot, delicious falafel."
